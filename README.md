<h3>C++</h3>
Who doesn't love C++?

I know I Do. 

If this Package is interesting to you you don't forget to look at 
[The C++ Behind some of it](https://github.com/CameronCS/csJava/tree/main/c%2B%2B%20behind%20some%20of%20it)


C++ Documentation is coming soon

The only reason "C" has the highest representation is because of all the JNI include files.

This is still a Java package
